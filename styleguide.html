    <div class="paraonetext margin-left">Cultural production in the third millennium is totally flat. <br> The information we make and share travels through media that lack hierarchy or centrality. <br> There is no principal authority, no recognized arbitrator, and no centralized archive. <br> <b>There is no perspective, no yesterday, and no tomorrow. </b><br> Flatness has neither a limit, nor a horizon. <br> It has permanently changed our relationship with time and space. <br> As a contemporary metaphor, flatness describes how the invention of the Internet has restructured global society. </div>

    <div style="font-size: 23px; text-justify: distribute; width: 400px; position: relative; left: 150px;">More than 90 percent of our species has access to 3G, and there are more than seven billion mobile phones on the planet. Access to the World Wide Web is universally cheap, or even free. Any informational format, from any period of human history, is available at anytime, anywhere, and to anyone. In 1993, there were just 23,000 websites and less than 40 million users. In 2018, there are roughly a billion websites, and more than three billion users.</div>
